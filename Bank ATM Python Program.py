# Bank ATM Program - by Lee Gallagher

# This program is designed to replicate the experience of using an ATM that has the ability to allow the user to both withdraw and deposit cash

# Copious amount of (probably quite obvious) comments, as once again I'm new to using JSON with Python and I really need them!

# (0) Imports & JSON File (For Storing Current PIN)

# (1) Define Initial Functions & Variable Values
